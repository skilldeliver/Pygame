Story: This game is made for the "Snake Game Month!" challenge which initiator is Anthony Cook.
It is my first OOP project and I tried to made the theme function friendly for changes so that the 
user can personalize or add themes. Unfortunately you need some programming and pygame skills for this purpose.

Controls: Default control keys for controling the snake are W, A, S, D  and ↑, ←, ↓, →. I didn't add third option
or shortcut in the source code for changes because I think it is not appropriate. I mean which keys for direction
are used as much as the above keys? And for pause while playing - "ESC" or "P".

Software and Technology: VS Code, Photshop CC, Python 3, Pygame

Sources of the used media files are in "usedfiles.txt".
This game have and a GitHub repository and if you made new theme or cool changes feel free to contribute.
