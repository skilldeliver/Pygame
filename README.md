# Pygame
## Repository for my Pygame projects with Python.

In the past I had unsuccessful attempts to learn **programming**, I tried with **C++** and **JavaScript**. Fortunately in early 2018 I found **Python**.
I went through the [Codeacademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) then I solved many **problems** and 
read two **books** of [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart).
Later on I started designing and creating my own **games** with the **Pygame** module.

## Thoughts

The conclusion is that I learned how to use **statements**, **expressions**, **loops**, **functions** and **classes**.
I think **Pygame** and this type of simple **game development** is excellent for **beginners**, development of **logical thinking**,
learning the basics of **programming**, etc... But for long term don't get stuck with **Pygame**. 
Learn **web development** or other field, if you still like **game development** - great, move on **Unity** for example.
In **Pygame** there is no big **community** and **support**, it is not so **effective**, **fucntional** and **fast**, that is why you can't **develop**, find a **job** with it or make **big profit**.

    print("Pygame is a simple module great for beginners but on some point if you want to get better - move on.")
