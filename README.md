# Pygame
## Repository for my Pygame projects with Python.

In the past I had unsuccessful attempts to learn **programming**, I tried with **C++** and **JavaScript**. Fortunately in early 2018 I found **Python** :heart_eyes:.
I went through the [Codeacademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) then I solved many **problems** and 
read two **books** of [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart).
Later on I started designing and creating my own **games** with the **Pygame** module. :sunglasses:

## Content

There are 4 **games** in my **Pygame** repository. In the first game you control **space shuttle** trying not to crash with **obstacles**.
Second one is a **replication** of the famous scare jump game - **The Scary Maze** game. Third one it is not game but a **tool for drawing**. And the final one is **classic snake game** the **snake** is (Python) and the **food** (Other languages).

#### Here is my own rating for this games:
1. **Mamba** - :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:
1. **Shuttle and Obstacles** - :star: :star: :star: :star:
1. **Drawing Tool** - :star: :star:
1. **Scary Maze Game** - :star:

## Thoughts

The conclusion is that I learned how to use **statements**, **expressions**, **loops**, **functions** and **classes**.
I think **Pygame** and this type of simple **game development** is excellent for **beginners**, development of **logical thinking**,
learning the basics of **programming**, etc... But for long term don't get stuck with **Pygame**. 
Learn **web development** or other field, if you still like **game development** - great, move on **Unity** for example.
In **Pygame** there is no big **community** and **support**, it is not so **effective**, **fucntional** and **fast**, that is why you can't **develop**, find a **job** with it or make **big profit**.


```python
print("Pygame is a simple module great for beginners but at some point if you want to become better you should move on")
```
