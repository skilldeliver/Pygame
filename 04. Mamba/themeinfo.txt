For the folks who may be interested in creating theme I decided to add this guide file.

Before the essential part I should say that you need a little bit of photo editing, programming and GitHub skills.
The third one is optional because you can just connect with me and send me your work.

Here are the GUIDE steps:
    1. Open the mambathemes.py file.
        This is the file where you can add your changes
    2. There you will find a blueprint (form) of dictionary named "yourTheme"
    3. Make copy of this dictionary blueprint and and uncomment the copy.
        Please let the original blueprint stay there uncommented.
    4. Paste your uncommented copy in the function.
    5. Fill it with your values (check down bellow FILLING steps) and name the dictionary with your theme name.
    6. After you filled your dictionary copy with appropriate values type - themes.append(yourTheme).
        This should be done after dictionary initializing and themes declaring.

FILLING STEPS:
    To have working theme you need to fill all dict values.
    * Include all image files with convert() or convert_alpha()

    1. First change the name of the the dictionary with your theme name
        Your theme name should be different from other theme names
    2. "themeThumb" key - this is for your theme thumbnail
        - must be image file supported by Pygame
        In the theme section when you review themes - every theme have showcase image
        * add your name (or nickname) on any corner on your theme image
        * for better looking add border on your theme image

        - must be image file supported by Pygame
    4. "gameBack" key - this is for the game background
        - must be image file supported by Pygame

    5. "snakeHead" key - this is dictionary for the head element of the snake game
        - must be image file supported by Pygame
        - you can pass the same image for all keys if your head element it is not orientation sensitive
        (This means for example if your head have eyes or something like that - it is orientation sensitive)
    6. "foodIMG" key - this is for the image of the food
        - must be image file supported by Pygame
    7. "font" key - this is for the font of the text which displays the lenght of the snake

    10. Set the scale of all element to be appropriate - hint - transform module
    11. Include your folder of sprites in ThemeSprites
        name it in this format - yourThemeSprites
